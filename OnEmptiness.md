# Background

- 命どぅ宝: Life and the diginity of life shall be treated above all. Amount of time we are allowed in this universe is very very short.
- Compassion and taking pain of others onto oneself are the ultimate foundation for enlightenment.
- Everything you experience is empty and devoid of intrinsic existence.
- As such, everything is in its' essence, far beyond every conceptualization.
- No need for labeling as good or bad.
- No good nor bad in laws of nature.
- Be mindful of what brings peace and what brings destruction. See for example, ten non-virtuous deeds(十不善業).
- Non-virtuous deeds, if not hindered, will take lives of many in the end. As such, no non-virtuous deeds accepted, regaredless of large or small.
- Every conceptualizaion, only partial explanation of ultimate reality.
- Be hypothetical and be open to every possiblity.
- Get rid of egoistic thoughts, words and attitudes. These are only to harm yourself and others. Although egoistic deeds may seem to protect youself, know that it is their way to hide themselves and behave as if they are part of you.
