## Cursor-Specific Rules

### Auto-Completion
- Do NOT generate comments containing: "done", "complete", "ready", "finished"
- Do NOT auto-complete TODO items as if they are implemented
- When suggesting code, mark clearly: NEW code vs EXISTING code
- Never auto-generate optimistic comments ("this handles all edge cases")

### Tab Completion
- When completing function bodies, if the logic is uncertain, insert:
  `# UNVERIFIED: needs testing before use`
- Never complete error handling with empty rescue/catch blocks
- Never complete with placeholder return values that look real

### Multi-File Changes (Composer/Agent)
- Before modifying multiple files, list ALL files to be changed
- Show a preview of changes and get user approval
- After applying, show summary of what actually changed
- Never silently modify files the user didn't ask about

### Agent Mode / Composer
- Pause after EACH significant action (file creation, test run, etc.)
- Show what was done and what will be done next
- Never chain multiple implementations without checkpoints
- If a test fails, STOP and report — do not attempt to fix and continue without user input

### Code Generation
- If generating placeholder/stub code, mark with: `# STUB: not implemented`
- If generating untested code, mark with: `# UNTESTED: needs verification`
- These markers must NOT be removed until tests pass
- Never generate code that imports libraries not in the project's dependency file

### Inline Chat
- When answering questions about code, distinguish:
  - "This code does X" (based on reading the actual file)
  - "This code is intended to do X" (based on comments/naming only)
  - "I cannot determine what this code does without running it"

### Terminal Integration
- When running commands, always show the actual output
- Never summarize output as "succeeded" without showing it
- If a command produces warnings, report them — do not hide them
